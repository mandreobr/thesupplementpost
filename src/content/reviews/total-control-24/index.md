<div class="intro-box">
  Male prostate and urinary health naturally shift with age as inflammation
  builds, oxidative stress accumulates, circulation slows, and hormonal rhythms
  change. These gradual shifts often trigger urinary frequency, nighttime
  interruptions, weak flow, pelvic discomfort, low energy, and reductions in
  overall confidence.

<p>
  Total Control 24 (TC24) is presented as a natural men’s formula designed to
  reinforce the biological foundations that govern prostate health, urinary
  comfort, and vitality. Built around antioxidant-rich botanicals, phytosterols,
  polyphenols, hormonal-support minerals, and pro-circulatory compounds, TC24
  supports inflammation balance, urinary flow, antioxidant protection, and
  hormonal stability.

<h2>Prostate &amp; Urinary Health — Symptoms That Indicate It’s Time to Pay Attention</h2>

<p>
  The prostate and urinary system respond to years of accumulated stress —
  inflammatory activity, oxidative pressure, tissue sensitivity, hormonal
  fluctuations, and reduced microcirculation. Bladder irritability and
  age-related changes in pelvic tissue may intensify symptoms over time.
</p>

<h3>Common signs men experience include:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>weaker or slower urine flow</li>
  <li>difficulty initiating urination</li>
  <li>repeated nighttime trips to the bathroom</li>
  <li>a feeling of incomplete emptying</li>
  <li>pelvic or lower-abdominal tension</li>
  <li>sudden urgency from small fluid intake</li>
  <li>changes in energy, stamina, or motivation</li>
  <li>irritability linked to chronic pelvic discomfort</li>
</ul>

<p>These patterns often result from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>inflammation within prostate or bladder tissues</li>
  <li>oxidative stress weakening cellular resilience</li>
  <li>hormonal shifts influencing prostate sensitivity</li>
  <li>reduced pelvic circulation</li>
  <li>age-related changes in bladder smooth muscle</li>
  <li>microbial or irritant-triggered urinary discomfort</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Addressing these factors early can help men maintain urinary comfort and
  long-term prostate health — which is where TC24 aims to provide support.
</p>

<h2>What Is Total Control 24?</h2>

<p>
  Total Control 24 is a natural, once-daily prostate-support supplement
  designed to improve urinary flow, promote circulation, balance hormones, and
  support healthy inflammation levels.

  The formula blends well-established prostate support ingredients like pygeum
  and saw palmetto with emerging bioactives such as jaboticaba polyphenols,
  Lipophytol&reg;, tocopheryl nicotinate, neem, and boron.
</p>

<p>TC24 aims to support multiple interconnected pathways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>inflammation</li>
  <li>oxidative stress</li>
  <li>circulation</li>
  <li>nutrient delivery</li>
  <li>hormonal metabolism</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Its U.S.-made, non-GMO formula is produced in GMP-certified facilities for
  purity and safety.

<h2>Confirming What Is Scientifically Known About the Ingredients</h2>

<p>
  While TC24 itself has not been evaluated in clinical trials, many of its
  ingredients have strong scientific background:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Pygeum Africanum</strong> — shown in research to improve flow and
    reduce nighttime urination.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Saw Palmetto</strong> — widely studied for DHT metabolism and
    urinary comfort.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Jaboticaba Polyphenols</strong> — potent antioxidants supporting
    tissue defense.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Lipophytol&reg;</strong> — associated with enhanced circulation and
    nutrient transport.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Boron</strong> — supports hormonal balance and testosterone
    availability.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Neem &amp; Vitamin E Derivatives</strong> — provide antimicrobial
    and antioxidant support.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Together, these mechanisms form a biologically sound rationale for the
  formula’s prostate-support role.
</p>

</p>

<h3>4. Balances hormones</h3>
